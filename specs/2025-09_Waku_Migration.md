## Decisions Made

### Target Runtime Architecture

**Decision**: Use Option 2 without CloudFront - API Gateway + Lambda for SSR

**Architecture**:

User → API Gateway → Lambda (Waku SSR)
                   ↘ S3 (static assets)

**Rationale**:
- **Cost optimization**: Eliminates CloudFront minimum monthly costs (~$0.60/month)
- **Consistency with existing system**: Matches the current Golang API architecture using API Gateway + Lambda
- **Poor cacheability**: Application content is user-specific, making CloudFront caching benefits minimal
- **Simplified deployment**: Single deployment pattern for all services in the CDK stack
