The access tokens are validated twice on each request: first with the authoriser `api/lambdas/authorizer/main.go`, then by the code on each lambda. You need to
remove the code related to the authorisation from the code of the handlers.

Lambda handlers are in `api/lambdas`, example: `api/lambdas/create-album/main.go`. And you can find the ones that are using the authorisers in CDK deployment
scripts: `deployments/cdk/lib/archive/archive-endpoints-construct.ts`, `deployments/cdk/lib/catalog/catalog-endpoints-construct.ts`.

Authorisation code is looking like `common.RequiresAuthenticated(...)` or `pkgfactory.AclCatalogAuthoriser(ctx).CanCreateAlbum` which is already done in the
authorizer.

The lambda handlers still need the `usermodel.CurrentUser` that should be loaded from the context, generated by the authoriser, and read by the handler.

The acceptances criteria are:

1. all lambdas that are using the authoriser should get the authorising code replaced by reading the context
2. do not introduce any security hole
3. the code must compile (`make build-go`)
