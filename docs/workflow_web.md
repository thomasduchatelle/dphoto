VIBE WORKFLOW: WEB FEATURE
=======================================

Step 1 - Requirements collection
---------------------------------------

We're starting a new feature, and you have to produce the Requirement Document. The document will be used for planning and must gather the following
information:

* What the feature **must do** ?
* What are the concepts introduced by the feature, and the concepts that already exists (using the **Ubiquity Language**) ?
* What are the interactions with external systems (user, APIs, ...) ?
* What is unknown and would need to be explored first ?

The document produced must follow the structure:

1. Feature **Summary** (1-3 sentences)
2. **Ubiquity Language** (up to 5 new terms)
3. **Scenarios** (maximum 5): enumerated list of actions or events leading to accomplishing the goal, by using the feature
4. **Technical Context**: bullet points of the things provided by the platform, supporting APIs, other domains, ...
5. List of **Explorations**: formulated as questions in bullet points

To build this requirement document, ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on
my previous answers to collect all the information required to write the document.

Here’s the idea:

Now that we’ve wrapped up the brainstorming process, can you compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification? Include all relevant
requirements, language, scenarios, technical context, and explorations so a developers team can immediately start the planning.
