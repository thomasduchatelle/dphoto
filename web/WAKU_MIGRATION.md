# Waku Migration - Phase 2 Complete

This document summarizes the Phase 2 migration from Create React App (CRA) to Waku.

## Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### What Was Done

#### 1. Build System Migration
- **Removed**: `react-scripts` (CRA build system)
- **Added**: `waku` 0.26.1 (modern React framework with SSR capabilities)
- **Configuration**: Created `waku.config.ts` with:
  - Vite path aliases for module resolution
  - Dev server configuration (port 3000)
  - Proxy configuration for `/oauth` and `/api` endpoints

#### 2. React Version Upgrade
- **Upgraded**: React 18.2.0 → React 19.1.1
- **Upgraded**: React DOM 18.2.0 → React DOM 19.1.1
- **Added**: `react-server-dom-webpack` 19.1.1 (required for Waku)
- **Updated**: TypeScript 4.9.5 → 5.9.2

#### 3. Test Infrastructure Migration
- **Removed**: Test configuration via react-scripts
- **Migrated**: Jest → Vitest for faster test execution
- **Added**: Vitest configuration (`vitest.config.ts`)
- **Updated**: Testing library to React 19 compatible versions
  - `@testing-library/react` 13.4.0 → 16.3.0
  - Added `@testing-library/dom` 10.4.1 (peer dependency)
  - Removed deprecated `@testing-library/react-hooks`
- **Updated**: Test files to use new `renderHook` from `@testing-library/react`
- **Updated**: setupTests.ts to use `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest`

#### 4. Client Component Architecture
- **Added**: `'use client'` directive to all React components
- **Approach**: All components remain client-side rendered
- **Routing**: Maintained existing React Router (BrowserRouter) setup
- **Pages Structure**: 
  - New: `src/pages/index.tsx` (Waku entry point)
  - Existing: `src/pages-old/` (original page components and routing)
  
#### 5. Cleanup
- **Removed**: CRA-specific files and configurations
  - `react-app-env.d.ts` (CRA type definitions)
  - `eslintConfig` from package.json
  - `browserslist` from package.json
  - `proxy` field from package.json (moved to waku.config.ts)
  - `%PUBLIC_URL%` placeholders from public/index.html
- **Updated**: `.gitignore` to exclude `/dist` (Waku build output)

### Test Results

```
✅ All 202 unit tests passing
✅ Build completes successfully (yarn build)
✅ Dev server starts correctly (yarn dev / yarn start)
✅ No CRA dependencies remain
```

### Build Output

The new build system produces:
- `dist/public/` - Client-side assets (static files)
- `dist/server/` - Server bundle for SSR
- `dist/server/ssr/` - SSR-specific bundles

Build size (gzipped):
- Main bundle: ~172 KB
- Vendor bundle: ~71 KB

### Migration Approach

We used a **minimal change strategy**:

1. **Client-Only Rendering**: All components use `'use client'` to maintain current behavior
2. **React Router Preservation**: Kept existing BrowserRouter-based routing intact
3. **Single Entry Point**: Created one Waku page that imports the existing App component
4. **No Refactoring**: Avoided restructuring components or logic during this phase

This approach ensures:
- **Zero behavioral changes** - app works exactly as before
- **Minimal risk** - no routing or component refactoring
- **Easy rollback** - changes are isolated to build configuration
- **Future optimization** - can gradually adopt SSR features in Phase 3

### Commands

```bash
# Development
yarn dev          # Start dev server (port 3000)
yarn start        # Alias for yarn dev

# Testing
yarn test         # Run all tests
yarn test:unit    # Run unit tests only
yarn test:visual  # Run Playwright visual tests

# Building
yarn build        # Build for production
yarn clean        # Clean build artifacts

# Component development
yarn ladle        # Run Ladle (Storybook alternative)
```

### Next Steps (Phase 3 - Future)

The migration spec suggests these could be done in Phase 3:
- ~~Migrate from Jest to Vitest for faster tests~~ ✅ Complete
- Optimize components to use SSR (remove unnecessary 'use client')
- Migrate to server-side data fetching patterns
- Consider cookie-based authentication instead of JWT
- Optimize CSS extraction for better SSR performance

### Breaking Changes from CRA

None. The application behavior is identical to the CRA version.

### Notes

- The `src/pages-old/` directory contains the original page structure
- All routing is handled client-side by React Router (no file-based routing used)
- The Waku page at `src/pages/index.tsx` is just a wrapper around the App component
- Service worker registration is preserved in public/index.html
